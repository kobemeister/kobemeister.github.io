        <h2>Here's some fun facts about an unfun boy.</h2>
        <p>My name is Hamilton "Kobe" Nguyen. I am currently a senior enrolled at <b>Hillcrest High School. </b>I thoroughly enjoy playing chess and video games, but sleep is the thing I enjoy the most. Feel free to challenge me in Smash if you want to lose!
